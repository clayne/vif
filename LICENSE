License for vif library and tools
===================================

Note: This covers all the files present in the 'include' and 'tools' directory
  (recursively).

List of dependencies licensed under the GPL:
  - The Gnu Scientific Library (GSL). Can be disabled by defining 'NO_GSL'.
  - The Fastest Fourrier Transform in the West (FFTW). Can be disabled by
    defining 'NO_FFTW'.

Note: If you enable the use of at least one of the above libraries, then you
  have to consider the whole vif library as licensed under the GPL. This means
  that your own code should also be publised under the GPL. Otherwise, the below
  license (MIT) applies to the vif library, and you are free to use any
  license for your own code.
